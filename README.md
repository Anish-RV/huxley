# Huxley
Huxley is a web application designed to manage the annual [Berkeley Model United Nations](http://bmun.org/) conference.

## About BMUN
The Berkeley Model United Nations conference is a high-school conference hosted every spring. Each year, we host over 1500 delegates from all over the country (and the world!), who compete in a simulation of the United Nations (as well as other international and historical bodies) to solve the world's most compelling problems.


## About Huxley
Huxley was conceived to simply abstract away database access from club officers to maintain data consistency. But as the size of our conference grew, so did the logistical complexity, prompting us to begin developing a full-scale web application to manage it.

### Vision
Our vision is to make Huxley the **best Model UN software in the world**: an application that makes the conference experience smoother than it's ever been, for both advisors and secretariats.

That means Huxley should be:

- **Centralized**: No more scrambling with email, Google Docs, and various other applications. Everything a secretariat needs to manage a conference should be right here.
- **Flexible.** No two conferences are the same. Secretariats of any conference, large or small, should be able to choose Huxley.
- **Innovative.** It must provide unique features that make the conference experience richer for advisors and secretariats.

And of course, Huxley should be **delightful to use.** We're aiming to provide the highest-quality user experience available for Model UN applications, via a focus on UI and features designed around ease-of-use.

### Built With
Huxley's built with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), a web development framework written in [Python](http://www.python.org). The frontend is simple HTML and CSS, and makes heavy use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).
